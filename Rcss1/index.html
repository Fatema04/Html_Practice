                <div class="left"><p>Makkah is a holy place of Muslims in Saudi Arabia where it is believed that the prophet Muhammad lived and taught more than 1,300 years ago. Makkah is the holiest city in Islam. Makkah had become an important place in the history by the time when Prophet Mohammed (peace is upon him) was born in about 570 AD. Makkah, the holy place has fallen with yearly ebb and flow of pilgrims as a result of growing Muslim community in the World and eventually the spread of Islam. The economic status of the city greatly depends on the large number of pilgrims visiting every year and their accommodation, feeding and transportation. (Ahmed Z.U. 1992).</p></div>
